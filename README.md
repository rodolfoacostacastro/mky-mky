# A mky-mky clone for an RP2040 custom board

This the code is situable for a makey makey that works with the chip RP2040.

To upload with the Arduino IDE, you will need to use this board definition(!):

https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico/releases/download/global/package_rp2040_index.json

go here --> Arduino >settings and scroll down until "Additional boards manager URLs" and paste the link above.

When selecting your board, asure you that it is the Raspberryi Pico/RP definition (and not the native from Arduino)


The code's been modified and works with the educational breakout-board created by Rodolfo Acosta Castro 
for the workshop "Into the Circuit" @ HfS, Berlin. October 2024
